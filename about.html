    <font color=“white” size="3"> Founded in 2010 by brother and sister duo Shawna and Shawn, the Snow Show has grown
        from a small company with 2 only plows into a family. We currently have 10 plows, 3 payloaders, 4 bobcats with
        pusher box attachments, and over 100 employees. Shawna and Shawn, born and raised die hard New Jerseyans,
        started the Snow Show on a whim, winter of 2010, after they were fed up with the lack of proper snow removal.
        When they first started plowing, they never expected their company to grow to where it is today but couldn’t be
        more grateful.
